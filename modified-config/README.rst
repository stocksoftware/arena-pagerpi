Modified Upgrades

This directory contains files that have been modified from their
original values; but do not contain anything security conscious.
Please check in the file as it appears on the system before modifying.
There is a ``setup.sh`` script in this directory which should be kept
up to date with the files intended locations; this file is not run
automatically and must be run as root.
