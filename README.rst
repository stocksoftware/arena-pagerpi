PagerPi: Manipulation of pager messages
=======================================

Listen for pager messages, do things with them.

Setup
-----

Running the ``updates/install.sh`` file as root will set up the
necessary systemd services.

Running the ``modified-config/setup.sh`` file as root will alter any
remaining configuration files as needed.

Otherwise, the system can automatically update from the ``master``
branch on github.
